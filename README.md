### About the Workflow File

The GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) is located in `.github/workflows/` and runs on every push to the `main` branch. It sets up JDK 17 and builds the Maven project located in the `backend/backend` directory.

This ensures that every code change is automatically built and verified, helping maintain code quality.
